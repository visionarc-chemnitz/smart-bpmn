            <h2><strong>1. Use of Third-Party Services</strong></h2>
            <p>
              Smart BPMN integrates third-party services, including but not limited to the Groq API, for processing and functionality.

By using our platform, you acknowledge and agree to these dependencies and their respective terms.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are not responsible for downtime, performance issues, or data handling policies of third-party services. Users should review Groq APIâ€™s terms and privacy policies before using our platform.
