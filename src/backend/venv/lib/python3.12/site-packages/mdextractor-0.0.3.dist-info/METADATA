# mdextractor

`mdextractor` is a Python package designed for extracting code blocks from Markdown text. It efficiently identifies blocks enclosed in triple backticks (\`\`\`), optionally preceded by language identifiers, and extracts their contents.

## Installation

To install `mdextractor`, use pip:

```bash
pip install mdextractor
```

## Usage

Using `mdextractor` is straightforward. Here's an example:

```python
from mdextractor import extract_md_blocks

text = """
\`\`\`python
print("Hello, Markdown!")
\`\`\`
"""

blocks = extract_md_blocks(text)
print(blocks)
# Output: ['print("Hello, Markdown!")']
```

This package is useful in various applications where extracting code or preformatted text from Markdown is necessary.
